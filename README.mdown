Bloomerl
========

This is an example and learning project on how to get started with rebar, eunit and
erlang. There is not much to see here, yet. The goal is to get a pure erland
implementation of bloom filters. This has been done before, and is nothing
noteworthy but the goal is also to keep this as close to idomatic erlang, as far
as I know.

So far the outside API is done, but the algorithm not implemented.
